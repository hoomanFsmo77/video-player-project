# video-player-project
a video player webpage like youtube.

This project was a bit challenging for me. In this webpage you can add your video and a thumbnail into your video list and your video will be saved in your indexed databse in your browser. you can edit, remove and enter a title , description and category for youy video. The controlers of the video player is customized and programmed by myself and I did not use the default controller of the browser.also you can search between your video list, change the theme of website and add video to your favorite.


To run this project, following the these steps:

1-where ever the package.json is open the gitbash and run this command(internet connection is neccessary):
npm i
now the all dependencies are downloading in node_module folder.

2- Then open  the project with your editor where the package.json file is.
